-- unicorn-squirt

unicorns are juicy creatures by nature and their emissions are sought after. the squirter ultimately is the one on the journey to unlock the power, but you can do everything in your power to guide that key into just the right spot.

shallow short strokes. alternate with popping down and out. be patient. 30 minutes or more of edging and foreplay may be necessary.

you want to create as much space between the clitoris and your body. some squirters can produce a full gush while being penetrated, some only when spread, others only during the pull out. try different strokes, different angles, their body will gradually respond.

make it sing. listen for noises like pulling feet from quicksand. a certain spot will produce much more noise. keep returning to that spot, concentrate your strokes here and success is near.

When the little window starts to open up, don't block it, just do whatever else you were doing and lean back to enjoy the show.
