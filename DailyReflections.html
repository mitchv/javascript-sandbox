todayquote [101] = ["JANUARY 1" , "I AM A MIRACLE" , "The central fact of our lives today is the absolute certainty that our Creator has entered into our hearts and lives in a way that is indeed miraculous. He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do for ourselves." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 25" , "This truly is a fact in my life today, and a real miracle. I always believed in God, but could never put that belief meaningfully into my life. Today, because of Alcoholics Anonymous, I now trust and rely on God, as I understand Him; I am sober today because of that! Learning to trust and rely on God was something I never could have done alone. I now believe in miracles because I am one!"];
todayquote [102] = ["JANUARY 2" , "FIRST, THE FOUNDATION" , "Is sobriety all that we can expect of a spiritual awakening? No, sobriety is only a bare beginning." , "AS BILL SEES IT, p. 8" , "Practicing the A.A. program is like building a house. First I had to pour a big, thick concrete slab on which to erect the house; that, to me, was the equivalent of stopping drinking. But it's pretty uncomfortable living on a concrete slab, unprotected and exposed to the heat, cold, wind and rain. So I built a room on the slab by starting to practice the program. The first room was rickety because I wasn't used to the work. But, as time passed, as I practiced the program, I learned to build better rooms. The more I practiced, and the more I built, the more comfortable, and happy, was the home I now have to live in."];
todayquote [103] = ["JANUARY 3" , "POWERLESS" , "We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.","TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 21","It is no coincidence that the very first Step mentions powerlessness: An admission of personal powerlessness over alcohol is a cornerstone of the foundation of recovery. I've learned that I do not have the power and control I once thought I had. I am powerless over what people think of me. I am powerless over having just missed the bus. I am powerless over how other people work (or don't work) the Steps. But I'm also learned I am <i>not</i> powerless over some things. I am <i>not</i> powerless over my attitudes. I am <i>not</i> powerless over negativity. I am <i>not</i> powerless over assuming responsibility for my own recovery. I have the power to exert an influence on myself, my loved ones, and the world in which I live."]
todayquote [104] = ["JANUARY 4" , "BEGIN WHERE YOU ARE" , "We feel that elimination of our drinking is but a beginning. A much more important demonstration of our principles lies before us in our respective homes, occupations and affairs." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p.19" , "It's usually pretty easy for me to be pleasant to the people in an A.A. setting. While I'm working to stay sober, I'm celebrating with my fellow A.A.s our common release from the hell of drinking. It's often not so hard to spread glad tidings to my old and new friends in the program. <br> At home or work, though, it can be a different story. It is in situations arising in both of those areas that the little day-to-day frustrations are most evident, and where it can be tough to smile or reach out with a kind word or be an attentive ear. It's outside of the A.A. rooms that I face the real test of the effectiveness of my walk through A.A.'s Twelve Steps."]
todayquote [105] = ["JANUARY 5" , "TOTAL ACCEPTANCE" , "He cannot picture life without alcohol. Someday he will be unable to imagine life either with alcohol or without it. Then he will know loneliness such as few do. He will be at the jumping-off place. He will wish for the end." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 152" , `Only an alcoholic can understand the exact meaning of a statement like this one. The double standard that held me captive as an active alcoholic also filled me with terror and confusion: "If I don't get a drink I'm going to die" competed with "If I continue drinking it's going to kill me." Both compulsive thoughts pushed me ever closer to the bottom. That bottom produced a <i>total</i> acceptance of my alcoholism - with no reservations whatsoever - and one that was absolutely essential for my recovery. It was a dilemma unlike anything I had ever faced, but as I found out later on, a necessary one if I was to succeed in this program.`]
todayquote [106] = ["JANUARY 6" , "THE VICTORY OF SURRENDER" , "We perceive that only through utter defeat are we able to take our first steps toward liberation and strength. Our admissions of personal powerlessness finally turn out to be firm bedrock upon which happy and purposeful lives can be built." , "TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 21" , "When alcohol influenced every facet of my life, when bottles became the symbol of all my self-indulgence and permissiveness, when I came to realize that, by myself, I could do nothing to overcome the power of alcohol, I realized I had no recourse except surrender. In surrender I found victory - victory over my selfish self-indulgence, victory over my stubborn resistance to life as it was given to me. When I stopped fighting anybody or anything, I started on the path to sobriety, serenity and peace."]
todayquote [107] = ["JANUARY 7" , "AT THE TURNING POINT" , "Half measures availed us nothing. We stood at the turning point. We asked His protection and care with complete abandon." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 59" , "Every day I stand at turning points. My thoughts and actions can propel me toward growth or turn me down the road to old habits and booze. Sometimes turning points are beginnings, as when I decide to start praising, instead of condemning someone. Or when I begin to ask for help instead of going it alone. At other times turning points are endings, such as when I see clearly the need to stop festering resentments or crippling self-seeking. Many shortcomings tempt me daily; therefore I also have daily opportunities to become aware of them. In one form or another, many of my character defects appear daily: self-condemnation, anger, running away, being prideful, wanting to get even, or acting out of grandiosity. <br> Attempting half measures to eliminate these defects merely paralyzes my efforts to change. It is only when I ask God for help, with complete abandon, that I become willing - and able - to change."]
todayquote [108] = ["JANUARY 8" , "DO I HAVE A CHOICE?" , "The fact is that most alcoholics, for reasons yet obscure, have lost the power of choice in drink. Our so-called will power becomes practically nonexistent." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p.24" , `My powerlessness over alcohol does not cease when I quit drinking. In sobriety I still have no choice - I can't drink. <br> The choice I <i>do have</i> is to pick up and use the "kit of spiritual tools" (<i>ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS</i>, p. 25). When I do that, my Higher Power relieves me of my lack of choice - and keeps me sober <i>one more day</i>. If I could choose <i>not to</i> pick up a drink today, where then would be my need for A.A. or a Higher Power? `]
todayquote [109] = ["JANUARY 9" , "AN ACT OF PROVIDENCE" , "It is truly awful to admit that, glass in hand, we have warped our minds into such an obsession for destructive drinking that only an act of Providence can remove it from us." , "TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p.21" , "My act of Providence, (a manifestation of divine care and direction), came as I experienced the total bankruptcy of active alcoholism - everything meaningful in my life was gone. I telephoned Alcoholics Anonymous and, from that instant, my life has never been the same. When I reflect on that very special moment, I know that God was working in my life long before I was able to acknowledge and accept spiritual concepts. The glass was put down through this one act of Providence and my journey into sobriety began. My life continues to unfold with divine care and direction. Step One, in which I admitted I was powerless over alcohol, that my life had become unmanageable, takes on more meaning for me - one day at a time - in the life-saving, life-giving Fellowship of Alcoholics Anonymous."]
