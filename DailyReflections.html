He has commenced to accomplish those things for us which we could never do for ourselves." , "ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS, p. 25" , "This truly is a fact in my life today, and a real miracle. I always believed in God, but could never put that belief meaningfully into my life. Today, because of Alcoholics Anonymous, I now trust and rely on God, as I understand Him; I am sober today because of that! Learning to trust and rely on God was something I never could have done alone. I now believe in miracles because I am one!"];
todayquote [102] = ["JANUARY 2" , "FIRST, THE FOUNDATION" , "Is sobriety all that we can expect of a spiritual awakening? No, sobriety is only a bare beginning." , "AS BILL SEES IT, p. 8" , "Practicing the A.A. program is like building a house. First I had to pour a big, thick concrete slab on which to erect the house; that, to me, was the equivalent of stopping drinking. But it's pretty uncomfortable living on a concrete slab, unprotected and exposed to the heat, cold, wind and rain. So I built a room on the slab by starting to practice the program. The first room was rickety because I wasn't used to the work. But, as time passed, as I practiced the program, I learned to build better rooms. The more I practiced, and the more I built, the more comfortable, and happy, was the home I now have to live in."];
todayquote [103] = ["JANUARY 3","POWERLESS","We admitted we were powerless over alcohol - that our lives had become unmanageable.","TWELVE STEPS AND TWELVE TRADITIONS, p. 21","It is no coincidence that the very first Step mentions powerlessness: An admission of personal powerlessness over alcohol is a cornerstone of the foundation of recovery. I've learned that I do not have the power and control I once thought I had. I am powerless over what people think of me. I am powerless over having just missed the bus. I am powerless over how other people work (or don't work) the Steps. But I'm also learned I am <i>not</i> powerless over some things. I am <i>not</i> powerless over my attitudes. I am <i>not</i> powerless over negativity. I am <i>not</i> powerless over assuming responsibility for my own recovery. I have the power to exert an influence on myself, my loved ones, and the world in which I live."]
