<p align="left">10pm - 10:45 : EMBODIED CONSENT Workshop w/ Carey French
<img align="left" src="carey-headshot.jpg">
Consent starts in the body. To ask for what we want and state our limits, we first have to figure out what our desires and boundaries are! In this consent primer weâ€™ll feel into our bodies to notice our internal sense of yes and no, get familiar with the subtle language of sensation, and then practice communicating that with others. Practicing consent is what keeps us safe enough to have fun. Join us!
<br>
Bio: Carey French is a queer white cis woman from Seattle with a deep yearning to replace rape culture with consent culture and facilitate collective healing. She integrates somatic experiences of consent with nuanced discussions of power and privilege, inviting an embodied style of learning to get at the heart of what consent really means. She supports individuals and communities in practicing tools for safe, authentic connection and mutual celebration! She thinks boundaries are sexy.

I'm a Seattle-based front-end web developer and designer

My degree is in Visual Communications from Whatcom Community College up in Bellingham, where I started out as a print production artist and later moved into the game industry doing Flash animation. I spent longer than I care to admit specializing in Flash, and obviously reached a pivot point around 2011 into front-end web development, which has been my primary focus since leaving my last full-time design position. I have a wide variety of freelance projects under my belt utilizing technologies like WordPress, Drupal, React.js, Angular.js, jQuery, Bootstrap and SASS, on top of a solid foundation with HTML, CSS and JavaScript Core.
