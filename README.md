#My pomodoro clock:
	*
1. ##- JavaScript stuff -
	* Is synced to the computer clock and resets every hour
	* Cannot be paused
	* Has four blocks per hour: two on-blocks or works (B*) and two off-blocks or breaks (b*)
	* Default block lengths: B1 = 15, b2 = 5, B3 = 20, b4 = 10
	*
	*
2. ##- HTML stuff - 
	* Draws a wedge shape of 1 degree every 10 seconds until it fills a circle.
	* Switches from Color 1 to Color 2 depending on whether break is 'on' or 'off'.
	* Title and background colors also change. (SASS?)
	*
3. ##- CSS stuff -
	* Plays a 'yoohoo' whistle sound when break starts
	* Plays a 'honk' noise when break ends

I'm a Seattle-based front-end web developer and designer

My degree is in Visual Communications from Whatcom Community College up in Bellingham, where I started out as a print production artist and later moved into the game industry doing Flash animation. I spent longer than I care to admit specializing in Flash, and obviously reached a pivot point around 2011 into front-end web development, which has been my primary focus since leaving my last full-time design position. I have a wide variety of freelance projects under my belt utilizing technologies like WordPress, Drupal, React.js, Angular.js, jQuery, Bootstrap and SASS, on top of a solid foundation with HTML, CSS and JavaScript Core.
